# Notes
  1. GUIs or command line interfaces are not provided to run the exercise.
  1. The exercise starts with the *index.js* file. The scripts in the file only cover the edge case - one has a strike for every roll. It will output the score for this case.
  1. It's expected that the test cases in the *index.test.js* file cover all the situations that could happen in the bowling game exercise. However, you are free to add more test cases to the test file.
  1. The codes are well commented and function/variable names are expected to explain themselves.
